# Coder Self-Critic Instruction

You are now entering the **Self-Critic Review** phase.
Before your work is submitted to the external strict Auditor, you must critically review your own implementation for **Cycle {{cycle_id}}**.

**OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
1. **SELF-CORRECTION**: Do NOT just output an audit report to me. **YOU MUST FIX THE CODE YOURSELF.** If you find any issues during this self-review, use your tools to modify the files, run tests, and ensure everything is perfect.
2. **BE STRICT**: The external Auditor is extremely unforgiving. Catch your own mistakes now.


**CORE PRINCIPLE: HIERARCHICAL DESIGN (Thinking Protocol)**
You must verify your implementation against the architectural hierarchy:
1.  **Global Vision** (`SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`): Does the code respect the global boundaries and design patterns?
2.  **Detailed Design** (`SPEC.md`): Does the implementation exactly match the specific blueprint for this cycle?
3.  **Code Blueprint** (Schema/Pydantic): Are the data structures robust, strictly typed, and validation-ready?
4.  **Verification Design** (Tests): Are tests exhaustive and do they truly verify the requirements?

**THINKING BLOCK REQUIREMENT**: At the beginning of your response, you MUST include a `<thought>` block where you perform an "Audit Gap Analysis" and identify any discrepancies between your current code and the hierarchy before applying fixes.

**DOMAIN CONTEXT (CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS)**:
Verify against the Domain Context and Scale from the `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`,  `SPEC.md` (in **Cycle {{cycle_id}}**) and `UAT.md` (in **Cycle {{cycle_id}}**) files.

**CONSTITUTION (IMPLICIT REQUIREMENTS)**:
Verify your code against these standards:
1.  **Scalability**: No OOM risks, No N+1 queries.
2.  **Security**: No hardcoded secrets.
3.  **Maintainability**: No hardcoded paths/settings. Everything must be in `config.py` or Pydantic models.
4.  **Strict Typing**: Every function MUST have complete type hints. No `Any` unless absolutely necessary and documented.

## Audit Guidelines
Review your code critically against the following checklists:

### 1. Functional Implementation & Scope
- [ ] **Requirement Coverage**: Are ALL functional requirements listed in `SPEC.md` implemented?
- [ ] **Logic Correctness**: Does the logic actually work? Is the logic correct, optimal and efficient?
- [ ] **System Integrity**: Did you accidentally delete or modify the `.nitpick/` directory? **Check your git status and ensures it is UNTOUCHED.** If your PR contains a deletion of `.nitpick/`, YOU MUST FIX IT IMMEDIATELY.
- [ ] **Preservation of Existing Assets**: Did you unnecessarily delete or rewrite existing code or tests? Ensure your changes maximize compatibility and affinity with existing assets. Changes should be additive where possible.

### 2. Architecture, Design & Maintainability
- [ ] **Layer Compliance**: Follows `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` without bypassing layers?
- [ ] **Single Responsibility (SRP)**: No God Classes?
- [ ] **Simplicity (YAGNI)**: No over-engineering?
- [ ] **NO Hardcoded Settings**: All config via `config.py`/Pydantic?

### 3. Data Integrity & Security
- [ ] **Strict Typing**: Pydantic models used at boundaries?
- [ ] **Schema Rigidity**: `extra="forbid"` used on schemas?
- [ ] **Security**: No hardcoded secrets/paths? No injections?

### 4. Scalability & Efficiency
- [ ] **Memory Safety**: **NO** loading entire datasets into memory. Use Iterators/Streaming.
- [ ] **I/O Efficiency**: **NO** I/O inside tight loops. Use batching.

### 5. Test Quality
- [ ] **Traceability**: Tests exist for all requirements?
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Are "unhappy paths" (errors, edge cases) tested?
- [ ] **Mock Integrity**: Mocks should simulate external failures/services, NOT the System Under Test (SUT). Ensure the actual implementation is being executed.
- [ ] **Test Execution**: Do all tests pass without errors?

## 🚨 ZERO TOLERANCE FOR HARDCODING 🚨
Search your own code for magic numbers, magic strings, unexplained constants, hardcoded paths, and hardcoded credentials. If you find any, extract them to config.

## 🚨 ANTI-MOCK VERIFICATION (CRITICAL) 🚨
You must not leave any code half-finished.
Remove any `TODO`, `FIXME`, empty functions, `pass`, `...`, or fake log outputs (e.g., just printing `logger.info("Processing...")` instead of performing the actual logic).
You must implement the real logic required by the specification. If any core logic is simulated or stubbed out in the production code, you MUST fully implement it before replying.

## 🚨 MUST PASS STATIC TESTS 🚨
Before completing this self-review, you MUST confirm that all static checks and tests pass. This is non-negotiable.
1. **Tests & Coverage**: Run `pytest` and verify the coverage reports.
2. **Linting & Formatting**: Run `ruff check .` and `ruff format .`.
3. **Type Checking**: Run `mypy .`.

**CRITICAL LOOP RULE**: If you modify even a *single line of code* during this self-critic phase (either manually or via auto-format), you MUST restart the entire static validation sequence from the beginning before raising the PR.
*Example Workflow:*
1. `ruff check .` -> OK
2. `ruff format .` -> Files modified...
3. 🔁 You MUST start over and run `ruff check .`, `mypy .`, and `pytest` again to ensure the modified files did not introduce new issues.

**FINAL ACTION**:
If you found ANY of the above issues, **FIX THE CODE NOW** using your file editing tools, re-run your tests, and confirm they pass.
Once you are 100% confident your code is perfect, reply confirming that the Self-Critic review is complete and the code is ready for the external Auditor.
